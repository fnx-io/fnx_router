# fnx_router

Declarative hierarchical router for Polymer Dart 1.0. Use it like this:

	<fnx-router>
		
		<a href="#/amazing/stuff">show me amazing stuff</a>
		<a href="#/amazing/features">show me amazing features</a>
	
		<fnx-router route="amazing">
		
			<fnx-router route="stuff">
				<h1>wow!</h1>
			</fnx-router>
			
			<fnx-router route="features">
				<h1>no way!</h1>
			</fnx-router>
			
			...


Comes in with handy Polymer `@bahavior` which you can use to make **any of your elements** routing capable.

_Note: Work in progress, I'll continue to develop this package as I use it in our Polymer projects._

## Routing

The purpose of this package is to allow you to show/hide your elements depending on `window.location.hash`
value. Every element `with FnxRouterBehavior` has `route` attribute and becomes subject of routing.

	<fnx-router route='user'>
		<my-cool-element route='edit'>
			...

Elements create a tree hierarchy of _routing nodes_ (subtree of DOM, if you want).
Their absolute route depends on route of their parents (and recursively up to the root element).

	<fnx-router> <!-- this is a routing root and it has no
	                  "route" attribute , it will be visible always -->
	                  
		<fnx-router route="amazing"> <!-- visible on #/amazing -->
		
			<fnx-router route="stuff"> <!-- visible on #/amazing/stuff -->
			
				<fnx-router route="vol1"> <!-- visible on #/amazing/stuff/vol1 -->

Level separator `/` is a constant provided by *fnx_router*.

## Navigation

Your user can navigate through your app by simply changing location anchor:

	<a href="#/amazing/stuff">show me amazing stuff</a>
	<a href="#/amazing/features">show me amazing features</a>

However - this requires you to know the absolute path (absolute route) to the element,
which is not very practical - hierarchical routing then loses it's purpose.
There are several other ways how to navigate.

	<fnx-router>
		
		<a href="#" data-router="#/amazing">open amazing menu</a>
	
		<fnx-router route="amazing">
			
			<a href="#" data-router="./stuff">stuff</a>
			
			<a href="#" data-router="./features">features</a>
			
			<a href="#" data-router="../regular">hide amazing, show regular</a>
			
			<fnx-router route="stuff">
				<h1>WOW!</h1>
			</fnx-router>
			
			<fnx-router route="features">
				<h1>NO WAY!</h1>
			</fnx-router>
			
		</fnx-router>
		
		<fnx-router route="regular">
			This is pretty regular. Go see
			<a href="#" data-router="../amazing">something amazing</a>.			
		</fnx-router>

All routing nodes listen for `tap` event (`@Listen("tap")`). If the event's target contains `data-router`
attribute, tap event is canceled and processed by router (actual `href` or other default action is ignored).
Possible values of `data-router` are:

- `#/something` - absolute path to required element
- `./something` - relative path to this element's child
- `../something` - relative path to this element's siblink (only single '../' is supported for now, you cannot double-dot your path all the way up like '../../')

Your `data-router` value must start with either `#/`, `./` or `../`.

	<a href="#" data-router="./baby-boy">pictures of my boy</a>	
	<a href="#" data-router="./baby-girl">pictures of my girl</a>	
	<a href="#" data-router="../my-dumb-brother">pictures of my brother</a>

You can also change the route programmatically, but more about this later.

## fnx-router element

**fnx_router** package contains `<fnx-router>` element. It's a
simple `display: block;` element. You can use it instead of
your regular `<div>`. It has one special attribute - `route`. Whenever particular element should be visible, it toggles a bool
attribute `router-visible`. You can implement actual hiding anyway you want:

	<style>
		fnx-router:not([router-visible]) {
			display: none;
		}
		.show-ghosts fnx-router:not([router-visible]) {
			opacity: 0.2;
		}	
	</style>

_Note: It's discouraged to remove elements from DOM tree, see
[polymer-dart wiki](https://github.com/dart-lang/polymer-dart/wiki/data-binding-helper-elements#conditional-templates)_

## Routing parameters

It would be nice to have routes like this: `/user/1234/edit`, but in current
state of Polymer it would be difficult to create such link. Polymer doesn't
support expressions at this moment, so you cannot write
`href="/user/{{user.id}}/edit"`.

Because of this, your routes should be "hardwired constants" and everything what changes,
should be provided via parameters.

	<a href="#/my/hardwired/route;3.1415;another-parameter">go for PI</a>

You still cannot render `href="#/my/hardwired/route;{{currentValueOfPI}};another-parameter"`, but you can use additional `data-router` attributes:

	<a href="#"
		data-router="#/my/hardwired/route"
		data-router-param1="{{currentValueOfPI}}"
		data-router-param2="another-parameter"
		>go for PI</a>

## Using router in your elements

`fnx-router` element is really just a smarter div. You will probably need to listen to routintg events,
fetch data from API when your element becomes visible etc. Good news - thanks to [Polymer behaviors](https://github.com/dart-lang/polymer-dart/wiki/behaviors),
it's really easy.

Enhance your element with `FnxRouterBehavior` like this:

In your template:
	<dom-module id="my-smart-rest-element" attributes="route">

In your class:

	class MySmartRestElement PolymerElement with FnxRouterBehavior {
	...
	
And add a callback for visibility changes:
	
	void routeChanged(bool visible, List<String> params) {
		if (visible) { foo(); } else { bar(); }
	}
	
For example, `fnx-router` element looks like this:

    @PolymerRegister("fnx-router")
    class FnxRouter extends PolymerElement with FnxRouterBehavior {
    
      FnxRouter.created() : super.created();
    
      void routeChanged(bool visible, List<String> params) {
        if (visible) {
          toggleAttribute("router-visible", true);
        } else {
          toggleAttribute("router-visible", false);
        }
    
    }

It cannot be easier! `routeChanged` callback will be invoked each time when:

- your element is invisible and should become visible
- your element is visible and should become invisible
- you element is visible and should stay visible, but params changed (see _Routing parameters_ above)

## API

With `FnxRouterBehavior` your element has access to:

	// current state of visibility
	@property(notify: true)
	bool routerVisible = false;
	
	// last routing parameters
	@property(notify: true)
	List<String> routerParams = [];
	
	// absolute route to parent element (/amazing)
	@property
	String absoluteParentRoute = null;
	
	// absolute route to this element (/amazing/stuff)
	@property
	String absoluteRoute = null;

## Notes, details and TODOs

Routing rules for element are evaluated in `attached()` Polymer lifecycle method and cannot be changed later.

**fnx-router** works only with **shady DOM**.
